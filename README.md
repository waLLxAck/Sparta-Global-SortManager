## Introduction

---

SortManager is the product of the first two weeks of my training at [Sparta Global](https://www.spartaglobal.com/), in the Java Dev team. It encompasses concepts such as:

- Exceptions

    Both from `java.lang` and two custom built ones

- Interfaces

    In our case two interfaces are used: `Sorter` and `BinaryTree`

- Industry level design

    The project aims to follow **SOLID** design principles

- The four pillars of OOP

    Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism

- Nested Classes

    The `Node` class inside the binary tree.

It also makes use of **Maven** as the dependency management and build tool, **JUnit-Jupiter** for unit testing, **log4j2** for logging throughout the program.

It's main focus is around sorting algorithms and in particular:

1. Bubble sort
2. Merge sort
3. Tree sort

Another thing that is explored is how each algorithm performs next to each other. Performance tests happen withing the testing section of the solution.

## Built with

---

The project was built entirely using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). 

## Getting started

---

You need to have downloaded IntelliJ on your computer, either the [community version](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows&code=IIC) or the [ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows) one.

Then you need to clone the repo. For windows users, run the following command in Git:

`git clone https://github.com/waLLxAck/Sparta-Global-SortManager/tree/master`

*Note: You can use IntelliJ for cloning, too.*

Once you've done that, all you have to do is open up the project in the IntelliJ.

## Usage

---

You can use the system to either learn from the design and/or coding or to sort custom and pre-existing ones. 

## Contributions
